<h1>Hi, I'm Fifa!</h1>
<p>(If you're looking for Saharach Thaiutai, you've found the right place!)</p>

- I'm currently a <b>final year biochemistry</b> student at <b>King's College London</b> with a burning passion for the field of <b>data analytics, data management</b>... and pretty much anything else to do with tech!
- During my penultimate year of university, I undertook an introductory module into programming and instantly fell in love with it.
- Recently, I decided to pick up C#, in the hopes of expanding my coding and programming skillset further. At the moment, I'm working towards my C# certification endorsed by Microsoft!
