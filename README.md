<h1>Hi, I'm Fifa!</h1>
<p>(If you're looking for Saharach Thaiutai, you've found the right place!)</p>

- I'm a <b>recent graduate</b> from <b>King's College London</b> with a burning passion to get involved in the field of <b>data analytics, data management</b>... and pretty much anything else to do with programming! 
- During my penultimate year of university, I undertook an introductory module into programming and instantly fell in love with it.
- I then took a bioinformatics course which took me further down the data analysis rabbit hole!
- Recently, I decided to pick up C#, in the hopes of expanding my coding and programming skillset further. At the moment, I'm working towards my C# certification endorsed by Microsoft!
